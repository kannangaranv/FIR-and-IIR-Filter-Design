# FIR-and-IIR-Filter-Design
This is an individual project related to module EN2063-Signals and Systems.
The objective of this project is to provide experience in the design of FIR and IIR digital filters for prescribed specifications. For FIR filters, the windowing method (in conjunction with the Kaiser window) is used whereas, for IIR filters, the bilinear transformation method is used.
